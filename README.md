--------Flight Fare Prediction--------

----Overview----

         This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts flight ticket prices based on key features. 
         It uses the Extra Trees Regression model for accurate predictions and is deployed using Flask for easy accessibility and user interaction.

----Features-----

          Predicts flight fares based on:
          Airline
          Source and Destination
          Journey Date (day and month)
          Departure and Arrival times
          Duration of the flight
          Total number of stops
          Additional Information
        - User-friendly interface powered by Flask.
        - Visual insights into factors influencing flight pricing.
        
----Technology---

          Programming Language: Python
          Framework: Flask
          Machine Learning Algorithm: Extra Trees Regression
          Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
          Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
          
---Dataset---

          The dataset used in this project is saved in a file named Flight_Fare.xlsx. 
          Users can replace it with their dataset as needed, ensuring it follows a similar structure.

---Model Training---

        - Data Preprocessing:
        
          Handled missing values.
          Converted date and time features for better analysis.
          Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
          Scaled numerical features.
          Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
          
         - Model Selection:
         
          Chose the Extra Trees Regression model for its robustness and accuracy.

         - Hyperparameter Tuning:

          Optimized model parameters using GridSearchCV to enhance performance.
          
----Usage----

          Open the application via Flask (usually hosted locally or on a specific server).
          Input flight details like airline, source, destination, journey date, etc.
          Click the 'Predict' button to get the estimated flight fare.
          
---Limitations---

          Predictions are limited to the features present in the dataset.
          Performance may vary with unseen data or outliers.
          Relies on the accuracy of the input data.
          
---Future Enhancements----

          Include additional features like class type (economy/business) and airline popularity.
          Experiment with advanced algorithms like XGBoost for better performance.
          Deploy the application to a cloud platform for wider access.
          Add graphical representations of fare trends and feature importance.
